# RAG-with-fiction-books
This project implements a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using custom PDF books (e.g., Harry Potter series) as the knowledge source.  The goal is to build a question-answering system that answers queries strictly based on the uploaded documents instead of relying on general internet knowledge.
